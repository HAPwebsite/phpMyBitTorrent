<p>This disclaimer must be considered as <b>rules</b> and &quot;<b>legal notice</b>&quot; the Bit Torrent Service (the &quot;Service&quot;) offered by P2P-Evolution.</p>
<p>P2P-Evolution offers the Service to the users that visit the portal that can be reached at
http://p2p-evolution.com by his/her own Internet connected PC.</p>
<p>The Service allows the user to access to a Bit Torrent file archive (for
information about Bit Torrent, protocol specifications and programs required to use it
please consult <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com">

http://www.bittorrent.com</a>) in a free and anonymous form</p>
<p>Please remember that:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>P2P-Evolution promotes and stimulates free information exchange between people,
        without limitations of country, age, gender, civil state, race, religion, etc.</p></li>
        <li><p>P2P-Evolution promotes, stimulates and defends &quot;freeware&quot; and Open Source products</p></li>
        <li><p>P2P-Evolution retains important communication and socialization on the Internet, and promotes it</p></li>

        <li><p>P2P-Evolution defends the rigths of consumers, artists, software developers, minors
        and people around them</li>
        <li><p>P2P-Evolution does not allow illegal activities on the web site</p></li>
        <li><p>P2P-Evolution does not have human and technological means needed to monitor data traffic
        directly or indirectly made by using the Service</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Service is totally free and anonymous, in fact:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>You are not required to submit any confidential data
        like name, surname, address and phone number</p></li>
        <li><p>You're not required to pay money to use the Service</p></li>

        <li><p>P2P-Evolution does not directly earn money when a user submits or downloads a Torrent</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Service is subject to the application of all normatives about information transmission and
publication. Particularly, the user agrees that:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p><u>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service in order to exchange child-porn material</u></p></li>
        <li><p>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service in order to exchange copyrighted material
        without a distribution license</p></li>
        <li><p>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service in order to exchange material that is
        dangerous for the Public Security (like, as examples, manuals the constructions of fire, chemical,
        bacteriological weapons or material that, in any way, may promote illegal acts like terrorism)</p></li>
        <li><p>It is strictly prohibited to use the Service for fake-sharing activities
        (sharing corrupt or empty files)</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>Since the impossibility to check the effective content of a Torrent
        before its complete download</p></li>
        <li><p>Since the impossibility to determine whether a copyrighted file
        (remember that Open Source programs are still copyrightes)
        can be freely distributed over Internet or not</p></li>
        <li><p>Since the impossibility to constantly monitor the Torrent available on the portal
        and to judge their content</p></li>
        <li><p>Since that P2P-Evolution does not host any Torrent, but they all are shared in a private form
        by their owners</p></li>
</ul>

<p>P2P-Evolution declines any responsibility regarding Torrent files' contents and
the use done by final users. But, the Staff is available, by written request sent
to the e-Mail address <i>Black_heart at p2p-evolution dot com</i>, with full reason and details (and, in case of copyrighted material,
the name of the copyright owner) to &quot;ban&quot; a Torrent from the Tracker.
&quot;Banning&quot; consists in the impossibility, by users, to download a Torrent.
Differently from simple deletion, ban blocks future attempts to re-upload an illegal file .</p>
<p>The user accepts that:</p>
<ul>
        <li><p>There is an automated &quot;keyword&quot; filter that prevents users to upload illegal files.
        The filter is constantly updated by the Staff, but it is still subject to errors.
        In the case a good file is considered illegal by the system, we invite the user to rename it
        and accept our apologizes for the inconvenience.</p></li>

        <li><p>The above filter can, upon written request, sent via e-Mail to <i>Black_heart at p2p-evolution dot com</i> and from exclusively the
        copyright owner or his/her legal representant, be updated by te Staff in order to block
        a copyrighted Torrent upload</p></li>
        <li><p>There is a &quot;log&quot;, not available to anybody, that keeps track of user actions
        in order only to prevent illegal activities such as pedophilia. The above log is kept
        with all most advanced security and cryptography measures by P2P-Evolution's Privacy Administrator,
        and only the lines regarding an illegal Torrent may, upon written request, be shown to the
        Authorities, under law procedures</p></li>
